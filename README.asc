= Numeracy, Modelling and Data Management

This book is written in support of a course offered to PhD students within the http://www.ed.ac.uk/home[University of Edinburgh's] 
http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/geosciences/[School of GeoSciences]
and across the http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/geosciences/postgraduate/phd/e3[Edinburgh E3 Doctoral Training Partnership].

== How To generate the book

You will need to have https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/[Ruby] installed on your computer,
as well as https://rubygems.org/[RubyGems]. You can learn how to install these in the appendices of this book
(which you should be able to read in a text editor or on Github).

You then should install the ruby package `bundler` using

[source,console]
----
$ gem install bundler
----

You also need to clone the files into the directory of your choice from Github.
Once you have bundler installed, you can build the book with:

[source,console]
----
$ bundler install
$ bundle exec rake book:build
----

This will build html and pdf versions of the book.

You can also build an html only version:

[source,console]
----
$ bundler install
$ bundle exec rake book:build_html
----

WARNING: The build process will make a folder called `images` in the root directory,
which on some systems must be deleted before new builds.

=== Quick build asciidoctor

You can also quickly generate the document by installing http://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor], and then running it on the `LSDTT_Book.asc` file:

[source,console]
----
$ gem install asciidoctor
$ asciidoctor NMDM.asc
----

WARNING: This quick generation will give you the text and cross-linking, but the images will not be linked.
For images to be properly linked you need to run `bundle exec` (see above).
