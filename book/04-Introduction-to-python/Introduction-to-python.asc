== Basic python

https://www.python.org/[Python] is a programming language that is becoming increasingly popular in the scientific community. 
In this course we want you to learn the basics of programming in a simple, well documented language, 
but one that is also powerful and that you can use in your research.
https://www.python.org/[python] ticks all of these boxes.
  
There are loads of resources to help you learn python, so I will not try to reinvent the wheel here.
