== Basic python

https://www.python.org/[Python] is a programming language that is becoming increasingly popular in the scientific community. 
In this course we want you to learn the basics of programming in a simple, well documented language, 
but one that is also powerful and that you can use in your research.
https://www.python.org/[python] ticks all of these boxes.

We recommend installing python using http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html[miniconda]. Information on installing python via miniconda can be found in the appendices for <<Setting up on Windows,Windows>>, <<Setting up on MacOS,MacOS>>, and <<Setting up on Linux,Linux>>. 
  
There are loads of resources to help you learn python, so I will not try to reinvent the wheel here. 
Instead you should familiarise yourself with the language using some of the many outstanding online resources dedicated to python.

You now should have some rudimentary knowledge of python. 
In the next chapter, we will go over how one plots data in python using matplotlib.
