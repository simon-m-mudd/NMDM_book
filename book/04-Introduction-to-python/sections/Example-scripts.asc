===Playing with some example scripts

I've created a number of python scripts that you might want to modify and test how they work. 
  
You can see the repository `by clicking here <https://github.com/simon-m-mudd/test_python_scripts>`_. 
  
You might want to **fork** this repository (look for link in upper right corner). 
More details about forking can be found on this website: :ref:`more_advanced_github`, 
and by `clicking on the GitHub help pages <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/>`_.
