=== Playing with some example scripts

I've created a number of python scripts that you might want to modify and test how they work.
You can download these scripts by cloning the file repository for the course.

[source,console]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/simon-m-mudd/NMDM_files.git
----

This will download a number of files, the ones for this excercise are in the directory `python_scripts`
and are called

* simple_load_data.py
* simple_load_data2.py
* simple_load_data3.py
