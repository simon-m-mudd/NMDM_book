=== Essentials

The following tools are core to the contents of this book,
and will need to be installed before you can work on the exercises in the book.

==== A text editor

A text editor is just a program to edit text. This should not be confused with a word processor, which adds a bunch of formatting and often saves files in binary format (meaning if you open them with a text editor and not a word processor all you will see is gibberish). 

Good text editors do things like highlight code syntax and allow you to easily navigate large numbers of files. 

A number of good options exist, all of which you can download for free:

* http://brackets.io/[Brackets] is an open source text editor that has many nice features and works on all major operating systems. This book and all the code examples in the course were written in this very nice text editor.
* https://atom.io/[Atom] is made by the people who made Github. It is also nice but I had trouble installing some extensions on a Windows machine. 
* https://www.textpad.com/[Textpad] is a lightweight text editor that has fewer features than the other options but runs very quickly. Only works on Windows.
* http://www.pspad.com/en/[PSpad] is lightweight like Textpad, but has some nice code navigation features (the author of this book uses it to edit pass:[C++] code because of these features). Only works on Windows.

If you want a consistent environment across operating systems we recommend http://brackets.io/[Brackets].

==== Git

[Git] is version control software. It helps you keep track of changes to your scripts, notes, papers, etc.
It also facilitates communication and collaboration through the online communities https://github.com/[github] and https://bitbucket.org/[bitbucket].

==== Python

Python is a programming language used by many scientists to visualize data and crunch numbers. You can also use it to automate data management.

You will need:

. The https://www.python.org/[python programming language]
.. http://www.scipy.org/[Scipy], for scientific python. It includes lots of useful packages like
... http://www.numpy.org/[Numpy] for fast numerics.
... http://matplotlib.org/[Matplotlib] for plotting.
... http://pandas.pydata.org/[Pandas] for data analysis.
.. https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip[pip] for python package management, although this is only needed if you like doing things by hand and don't use http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html[miniconda].
.. In addition, if you want a nice interface https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/[Spyder] is quite useful.
.. Also, if you are going to be working with geographic data, https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GDAL/[GDAL] is also recommended. 

==== R

https://www.r-project.org/[R] is a program and a programming language for statistical analysis. Compared with the other packages you will need, *R* is quite painless to install on your computer! Just download and install!

==== QGIS

This is a geographic information system (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system[GIS]). There is a commercial equivalent called https://www.arcgis.com/features/index.html[ArcGIS] which is widely used in industry, but http://www.qgis.org/en/site/[QGIS] is open source so you can install it without having an expensive institutional license. 

==== Inkscape

https://inkscape.org/en/[Inkscape] is an open source graphics editor, which has many of the same functionalities as Adobe Illustrator. It is very useful for preparing attractive figures for papers, reports and theses.
