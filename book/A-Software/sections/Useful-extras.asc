=== Useful extras

You could find these tools useful. In particular, my documentation is written using something called http://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor], which is implemented in a programming language called Ruby. I love http://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor] and can't say enough good things about it. But installation of Ruby and associated packages are not required for the course. 

==== Ruby

Ruby is a programming language used frequently by web developers and has many package for building documentation and automating collection of data over the internet.
In this book we will really only use it for documentation, but there is a large ecosystem of open source tools available in Ruby.
It hasn't been adopted to a great extent by the scientific community but you may still find useful tools, particularly if you are gathering online information.

You will need:

. The https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/[Ruby] programming language
.. https://rubygems.org/[Rubygems] for updating ruby.
.. http://bundler.io/[bumdler] for managing updates and making sure scripts are up to date.
.. http://rubyinstaller.org/add-ons/devkit/[RubyDev kit] which is needed for some other Ruby packages.
.. http://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor] for making notes, documentation and books.
. In addition you will need https://nodejs.org/[Node.js] for some of the Ruby tools to work.

==== pass:[C++] and fortran

A number of scientific programs are written in these languages so information on how to get them working on your windows machine is included here for completeness.

To get these working you will need

. The compiler. This is what translates the program into something the computer can understand.
. The tool `make`, which automates building programs.
. The tool `gdb`. which stands for gnu debugger, a tool for debugging code.
. The tool `gprof`, which is a profiler: it allows you to see which parts of your code are using the most computational resources.
