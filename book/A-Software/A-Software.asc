[appendix]
== Software

There are quite a few different components you need to get working on your system to perform the examples in this book (sorry!).
Some of these are essential, and some are optional and included for completeness.
In the following appendices, instructions for getting them installed on <<Setting up on Windows,Windows>>, <<Setting up on Linux,Linux>>, and <<Setting up on MacOS,MacOS>> are included. 

WARNING: Most of the software described here has reasonably simple installation packages for all operating systems. 
However, the videos are often presented in the context of a Linux shell. If you do not have access to a Linux server, your best bet is to follow our instructions for <<Creating a linux environment inside any computer>>.
