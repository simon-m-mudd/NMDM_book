=== Simple commands in the shell

Within unix/linux, we often work within something called the shell. It is a text based sytem that allows you to run programs and navigate and modify files. 

If you are used to windows-based systems, it may seem archaic to use a text based system, but scientists, engineerrs and programmers have been using
these systems for years and have designed them to be fast and efficient, once you learn how to use them. 

Here we will introduce you to some basic shell commands you will use frequently. 

==== External resources

You can start by watching the videos listed below (in the <<Videos>> section), 
but if you want more information there are numerous websites that list common shell commands:

If you want a gentle introduction to the shell,
