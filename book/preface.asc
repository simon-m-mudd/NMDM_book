== Preface by Simon M. Mudd

Welcome to Numeracy, Modelling and Data Management for the Natural Sciences.
Research in the Natural Sciences has evolved rapidly in concert with the rapid evolution of technology.
While the content of many natural science disciplines has certain fixed reference points (e.g., Darwinian evolution in Biology, Plate Tectonics in the Earth Sciences),
the methods by which today's research students conduct research is quite different from a generation ago.

This book has emerged from a course that I teach as part of a http://e3dtp.geos.ed.ac.uk/[doctoral training program] at the http://www.ed.ac.uk/[University of Edinburgh].
Students in our program have backgrounds in geology, geography, ecology, biology, and other allied fields. Their disciplinary knowledge is quite disparate. 
Regardless of discipline, however, research students need some shared tools to do research.
This course is designed to provide some basic tools that serve as a starting point for students to learn about numeracy, modelling and data management.
