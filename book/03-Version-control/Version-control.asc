== Version control with git

In this section we'll take you through some software call http://git-scm.com/[git]. 
It is version control software. This lesson will rely heavily on the lessons at http://software-carpentry.org/[Software Carpentry].

=== What is version control

Very briefly, version control software allows you to keep track of revisions so that you can very 
easily see what changes you have made to your notes, data, scripts, programs, papers, etc. 
It is also very useful for collaboration. 
  
In this course we are going to use it to keep track of your progress,
and in doing so we hope that techniques for producing reproducible research (see section :ref:`background-head`)
become second nature to you. 
  
If you want a more detailed explanation of version control, written in plain English, 
see the outstanding lesson available at software carpentry:
http://software-carpentry.org/v5/novice/git/00-intro.html.
  
==== git basics

The videos introduce you to the most basic operations in git, and if you want more written detail you can
look at the http://software-carpentry.org/v5/novice/git/index.html[git documentation on Software Carpentry].
  
We are going to start by making a markdown document. Markdown is a kind of shorthand for writing html pages. 
You don't really need to worry too much about markdown at this point, since we'll go through the basics in the videos. 
However, if you yearn to learn more, here are some websites with the basics:

* https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/
* https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet
* https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ 
* http://whatismarkdown.com/

You will want to use a text editor to write this file (**NOT WORD OR WORDPAD!!**); we recommend http://brackets.io/[Brackets] because it is both a nice text editor and because it works on Windows, Linux and MacOS.
