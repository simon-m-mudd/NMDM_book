=== Windows installation programs

Take a deep breath. I am afraid this is going to take a while.
It can be done, but you may psychological treatment before the end.
You might consider just installing a <<Turning your windows machine into a Linux machine,Linux Virtual machine>> instead of trying to get the software installed within a Windows environment.


==== Package management

If you are a windows user, you are probably used to installing software on windows the traditional way using installation files.
The tools we are using involve many linked programs, and installing them by downloading windows installers from their respective websites can be tiresome.
An alternative is to use something called a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager[machine package manager], which makes installing software a bit less of a hassle.

===== Chocolatey package manager

Here we will use a machine package manager built specifically for windows called https://chocolatey.org/[chocolatey].

To install *chocolatey*, type in the following in your **administrative** powershell:

  PS> iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

You then just have to sit back and wait while it installs.

NOTE: To test if chocolatey is working after the installation, type `choco -v`. If you get an error saying it is not a recognized name of a cmdlet or path, then simply close your powershell windows and open new ones.

Once you have chocolatey installed, you can get the additional packages that are required for the tools we use in this book by using the `choco` command.

==== Git
