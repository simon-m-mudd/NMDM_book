=== Windows installation programs

Take a deep breath. I am afraid this is going to take a while.
It can be done, but you may psychological treatment before the end.
You might consider just installing a <<Turning your windows machine into a Linux machine,Linux Virtual machine>> instead of trying to get the software installed within a Windows environment.

==== Git

Download and install https://git-for-windows.github.io/[git for windows]. 

There will be some options for you to select once you do this: the main one is something about line endings. I chose the "don't change line endings" option. 

Once this is installed you can right click on any folder in windows explorer and select the option `git bash here`. This will open a powershell window with git enabled. From there you can follow the instructions in the git chapter of this book.  

=== Python

The best way to install python is http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html[miniconda]

Once you have installed that, you can go into a powershell and get the other stuff you need:

[source,consol]
----
  PS> conda install scipy=0.18.0
  PS> conda install gdal=1.11.4
  PS> conda install spyder=3.0.0b6
----


==== Popular python distributions that you should not use. 

These are popular distributions but I've found http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html[miniconda] is best.

. http://python-xy.github.io/[Python(x,y)] contains all manner of useful packages for scientists.
I have found, however, that updating this is not so straightforward;
if you have a look at the http://python-xy.github.io/downloads.html[Python(x,y) downlaods page] you will see that the updates have dependencies that dead end,
so if you are on, say, Python(x,y) 2.6.X you will need to reinstall Python(x,y) 2.7.X if you want continued updates.
Python(x,y) is also huge: it includes *many* python packages, most of which you will never use.
. http://winpython.sourceforge.net/[Winpython] is another python package that has a nice updating interface.
. https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/[Anaconda] is another scientific package that includes all sorts of smaller packages.
It seems to be able to handle updates better than Python(x,y) through its `conda` updating interface.


=== R

Luckily, R has an installation package for Windows.
You can just download it from the https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/[R website].

=== Ruby

You can check to see if Ruby is installed on your system by typing

[source,consol]
----
  PS> ruby -v
----

and you can check the Rubygems version with

[source,consol]
----
  PS> gem -v
----

If you don't have it, just download and install from the https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/[Ruby website]. 

You will also need https://rubygems.org/pages/download[Ruby gems]: download it and run:

[source,consol]
----
  PS> ruby setub.rb
----

from the folder to which you downloaded the files.

==== Fix rubygems on Windows

At the time of this writing, rubygems is "broken" on Windows:
if you try to install a gem file you will get an error that says you cannot make an SSL connection.
You will need to fix this problem by https://gist.github.com/luislavena/f064211759ee0f806c88[copying a trust certificate into you rubygems folder].

. First download the file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rubygems/rubygems/master/lib/rubygems/ssl_certs/AddTrustExternalCARoot-2048.pem[AddTrustExternalCARoot-2048.pem].

WARNING: It seems some browsers add formatting to this file when downloaded (Chrome does this, for example).
I only managed to get this fix to work after downloading the file using Internet Explorer.

[start=2]
. Next, find the location of your gems installation:

[source,consol]
----
  PS> gem which rubygems
  C:/Ruby21/lib/ruby/2.1.0/rubygems.rb
----

. Go to the folder and then go into the SLL_certs subfolder.
In this case it is at: `C:/Ruby21/lib/ruby/2.1.0/rubygems/SSL_certs`.
Copy the `.pem` file into this folder. Rubygems should now work.

==== Install some gems

From here we can install some useful ruby gems.
http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] is really great for writing documentation.
http://bundler.io/[Bundler] is useful for keeping Ruby packages up to date.

[source,consol]
----
  PS> gem install asciidoctor
  PS> gem install bundler
----

=== C++ and Fortran

There are several options for installing c++ and fortran compilers on your Windows machine.
Two popular options, http://www.mingw.org/[Mingw] and https://www.cygwin.com/Cygwin] install something that behaves a bit like a Linux operating system
(<<Turning your windows machine into a Linux machine,but perhaps it is easier just to set up Linux within your Windows computer?>>).

Another option for c++ is to install the developer toolkit from Microsoft, https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx[Visual Studio express.
You can install the 2013 version using chocolatey:

[source,consol]
----
  PS> choco install visualstudioexpress2013windowsdesktop
----

You can also install the software by downloading from the https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx[Visual Studio website].

==== Cygwin

To install https://www.cygwin.com/[Cygwin], you must first install the program
https://www.cygwin.com/setup-x86.exe[setup-x86.exe] for a 32 bit system or
https://www.cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe[setup-x86_64] for a 64 bit system.

When you run `setup-*.exe`, you will get a window that looks like this:

.Cygwin setup.
image::images/cygwin_setup.jpg[Cygwin setup window]

Scroll down the the `devel` menu and select the following packages:

  binutuls
  gcc core
  g++
  gfortran
  gdb
  make

You can also install all sorts of other things from cygwin like *Ruby*, *Git* and *Python*, but you don't need to do that if you've already installed them.
In fact, you might want to make sure *git* is not selected if you have installed the Git powershell from the github desktop application.

Once you have selected the things you need, select *next*.
You might need to install a bunch of additional packages because your selected packages depend on them.
If this is your first time installing cygwin go and get a drink or have lunch since installation will take some time.
