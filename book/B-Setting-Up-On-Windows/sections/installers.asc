=== Windows installation programs

Take a deep breath. I am afraid this is going to take a while.

==== A text editor

In <<Software>> you can read about the various options for text editors, and why we recommend http://brackets.io/[Brackets]. Go to its website for the download. 

==== Git

Download and install https://git-for-windows.github.io/[git for windows]. 

There will be some options for you to select once you do this: the main one is something about line endings. I chose the "don't change line endings" option. 

Once this is installed you can right click on any folder in windows explorer and select the option `git bash here`. This will open a powershell window with git enabled. From there you can follow the instructions in the git chapter of this book.  

==== Python

The best way to install python is http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html[miniconda]

Once you have installed that, you can go into a powershell and get the other stuff you need:

[source,consol]
----
  PS> conda install scipy=0.18.0
  PS> conda install gdal=1.11.4
  PS> conda install spyder=3.0.0b6
----

.Popular python distributions you should not use
*****************************************
Below are popular distributions but I've found http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html[miniconda] is best. I learned this the hard way so you don't have to. 

. http://python-xy.github.io/[Python(x,y)] contains all manner of useful packages for scientists.
I have found, however, that updating this is not so straightforward;
if you have a look at the http://python-xy.github.io/downloads.html[Python(x,y) downlaods page] you will see that the updates have dependencies that dead end,
so if you are on, say, Python(x,y) 2.6.X you will need to reinstall Python(x,y) 2.7.X if you want continued updates.
Python(x,y) is also huge: it includes *many* python packages, most of which you will never use.
. http://winpython.sourceforge.net/[Winpython] is another python package that has a nice updating interface.
. https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/[Anaconda] is another scientific package that includes all sorts of smaller packages.
It seems to be able to handle updates better than Python(x,y) through its `conda` updating interface.
*****************************************

==== R

Luckily, R has an installation package for Windows.
You can just download it from the https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/[R website].

==== QGIS

Here are the https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html[QGIS Windows downloads].

==== Inkscape

Here are the https://inkscape.org/en/[Inkscape Windows downloads].

==== Ruby

You can check to see if Ruby is installed on your system by typing

[source,consol]
----
  PS> ruby -v
----

and you can check the Rubygems version with

[source,consol]
----
  PS> gem -v
----

If you don't have it, just download and install from the https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/[Ruby website]. 

You will also need https://rubygems.org/pages/download[Ruby gems]: download it and run:

[source,consol]
----
  PS> ruby setub.rb
----

from the folder to which you downloaded the files.

==== Fix rubygems on Windows

At the time of this writing, rubygems is "broken" on Windows:
if you try to install a gem file you will get an error that says you cannot make an SSL connection.
You will need to fix this problem by https://gist.github.com/luislavena/f064211759ee0f806c88[copying a trust certificate into you rubygems folder].

. First download the file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rubygems/rubygems/master/lib/rubygems/ssl_certs/AddTrustExternalCARoot-2048.pem[AddTrustExternalCARoot-2048.pem].

WARNING: It seems some browsers add formatting to this file when downloaded (Chrome does this, for example).
I only managed to get this fix to work after downloading the file using Internet Explorer.

[start=2]
. Next, find the location of your gems installation:

[source,consol]
----
  PS> gem which rubygems
  C:/Ruby21/lib/ruby/2.1.0/rubygems.rb
----

. Go to the folder and then go into the SLL_certs subfolder.
In this case it is at: `C:/Ruby21/lib/ruby/2.1.0/rubygems/SSL_certs`.
Copy the `.pem` file into this folder. Rubygems should now work.

==== Install some gems

From here we can install some useful ruby gems.
http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] is really great for writing documentation.
http://bundler.io/[Bundler] is useful for keeping Ruby packages up to date.

[source,consol]
----
  PS> gem install asciidoctor
  PS> gem install bundler
----

=== pass:[C++] and Fortran

From long and painful experience, don't try to do pass:[C++] and Fortran on Windows if you are doing scientific computing. Instead use https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant] to build a Linux server on your computer following these instructions: <<Using Vagrant to make a Linux server in your computer>>. 

If you have been trying to develop scientific software with these languages on a Windows machine an are hearing about Vagrant for the first time, once you finish setting and realise how amazing it is you can send flowers, chocolates, prosecco, etc. to:
