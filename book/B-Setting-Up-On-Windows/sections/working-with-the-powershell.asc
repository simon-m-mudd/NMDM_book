=== Working with the powershell

Much of what we do will be through a powershell window. 
This is a text-based interface into your windows system that allows you to install software and run scripts and code.
It functions like a linux terminal.

First of all, you need to get a powershell running. On my windows version, you just type *powershell* into the bit of Windows where you search for files or programs (it varies based on what windows system you are using). 
You should be able to find a way to get a powershell on your version of windows through the power of the internet. 

==== Administrator powershell session

Your computer might tell you that you don't have permissions to install things, in which case you can open an administrator session from a standard session
