=== MacOS installation programs

Many of the tools we will be using have nice, simple installation packages. However installing everything will take time. 

==== A text editor

In <<Software>> you can read about the various options for text editors, and why we recommend http://brackets.io/[Brackets]. Go to its website for the download. 

==== Git

On many MacOS systems, if you open a terminal window and type `git`, MacOS will install it for you if it doesn't already. Alternativly, you can download a http://git-scm.com/download/mac[MacOS installer]. 

==== Python

The latest MacOS systems come with python. Managing all the extra packages in MacOs is probably easiest with http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html[miniconda]. 

Once you have installed *miniconda*, you can go into a terminal and get the other stuff you need:

[source,consol]
----
  $ conda install scipy=0.18.0
  $ conda install gdal=1.11.4
  $ conda install spyder=3.0.0b6
----

==== R

Luckily, R has an installation package for MacOS.
You can just download it from the https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/[R website].

==== QGIS

The QGIS MacOS installers are https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html[located here].

==== Inkscape

The Inkscape MacOS installers https://inkscape.org/en/download/mac-os/[can be found here]. To get inkscape to work you will need something called https://www.xquartz.org/[Xquartz].

==== Optional: Ruby

You can check to see if Ruby is installed on your system within the terminal window

[source,consol]
----
  $ ruby -v
----

and you can check the Rubygems version with

[source,consol]
----
  $ gem -v
----

If you don't have it, just download and install from the https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/[Ruby website]. 

You will also need https://rubygems.org/pages/download[Ruby gems]: download it and run:

[source,consol]
----
  $ ruby setub.rb
----

from the folder to which you downloaded the files.

From here we can install some useful ruby gems.
http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] is really great for writing documentation.
http://bundler.io/[Bundler] is useful for keeping Ruby packages up to date.

[source,consol]
----
  $ gem install asciidoctor
  $ gem install bundler
----

==== Optional: pass:[C++] and Fortran

Let's be honest, if you are using pass:[C++] and Fortran you don't need me to tell you how to install stuff. But here is a http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-apple-mac-os-x-install-gcc-compiler/[instruction website] for completeness.
