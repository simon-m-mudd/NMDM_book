== Setting up on Linux

Setting up your system on Linux is considerably easier than setting up on Windows.
Before doing anything, open a terminal window. The `$` symbol below indicates commands typed into the terminal window.

WARNING: These commands are for *Ubuntu* and *Debian* flavors of Linux. Other flavors of Linux use different package managers, such as http://yum.baseurl.org/[yum].
If you don't use Debian of Ubuntu, you will need to look up the installation guidelines for the programs below.

=== A text editor

We recommend http://brackets.io/[Brackets]:

[source,console]
----
  $ sudo apt-get install brackets
----

Note that this will only work with a windowing system (i.e., not on a server-only version of Linux).

=== Git

To check if git is working, type

[source,console]
----
  $ git --version
----

If it isn't installed, install it with

[source,console]
----
  $ sudo apt-get install git
----

=== Python

To check if it is working, just type

[source,console]
----
  $ python
----

If it is working, it will tell you the version and you will get a command prompt that looks like this:

[source,console]
----
   >>>
----

You should have version 2.7 or above.

==== Installing python using miniconda

Native Linux users will probably want to do things using *pip* (see below) but you can aslo use http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html[miniconda]. First install miniconda using http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html#linux-miniconda-install[instructions here]. Then use the `conda` command to install stuff:

[source,consol]
----
  $ conda install scipy=0.18.0
  $ conda install gdal=1.11.4
  $ conda install spyder=3.0.0b6
----

==== Installing python using pip

If you don't have python, you should install both *python* and *pip*, which manages python packages.
To do that type:

[source,console]
----
  $ sudo apt-get install python2.7
  $ sudo apt-get install python-pip
----

==== Installing python packages using pip

To check if python packages are there, just try to import them. First start a python session:

[source,console]
----
  $ python
----

Then, try to import a package. For example:

[source,console]
----
  >>> import matplotlib
----

If the package does not exist, you will get an error message like this:

[source,console]
----
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  ImportError: No module named matplotlib
----

You can install all the packages at once with:

[source,console]
----
  $ sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib ipython ipython-notebook python-pandas python-sympy python-nose
----

You can upgrade packages with the pip command:

[source,console]
----
  $ pip install PackageNameHere --upgrade
----

=== R

You can check if R is working from the terminal window with:

[source,console]
----
  $ R
----

If it isn't there, you can install it with

[source,console]
----
  $ sudo apt-get install R
----

=== QGIS

Linux installers are on the https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html[QGIS downloads page]. You will need a windowing system for this. 

=== Inkscape

You can install with

[source,console]
----
 $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:inkscape.dev/stable
 $ sudo apt-get update
 $ sudo apt-get install inkscape
----

You will need a windowing system for this. 

=== Optional: Ruby

You can see if Ruby is ony your system by typing:

[source,console]
----
  $ ruby -v
----

If it isn't there, install with (this should seem routine by now):

[source,console]
----
  $ sudo apt-get  install ruby-full
----

=== Optional: pass:[c++] and fortran

You can check if these are working by typing (this assumes you are using the https://gcc.gnu.org/[GNU compilers])

[source,console]
----
  $ g++
  $ gfortran
----

You can install these with

[source,console]
----
  $ sudo apt-get install g++
  $ sudo apt-get install gfortran
----

These seem to install `gdb` and `make`, which is convenient.

=== Summary

Well, you have probably spent some time installing all of these software packages so relax for a bit and enjoy the beverage of your choice!
